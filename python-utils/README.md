============

 + convert_trx_to_junit.py:
     A simple python script which can be used to convert the *.trx files
     (generated by MS Visual Studio during a testrun) to junit compatible
     xml files. This is useful when your CI system can only interpret junit
     compatible files.

     Data for Skipped and other types of outcome has not yet been handled
     since I have not come across any test with outcome other than Failed
     or Passed in *.trx files
